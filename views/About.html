                When Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he
                would shortly be celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with
                a party of special magnificence, there was much talk and
                excitement in Hobbiton.
                Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the
                wonder of the Shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable
                disappearance and unexpected return. The riches he had
                brought back from his travels had now become a local legend,
                and it was popularly believed, whatever the old folk might
                say, that the Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with
                treasure. And if that was not enough for fame, there was also
                his prolonged vigour to marvel at. Time wore on, but it
                seemed to have little effect on Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was
                much the same as at fifty. At ninety-nine they began to call
                him well-preserved; but unchanged would have been nearer the
                mark. There were some that shook their heads and thought
                this was too much of a good thing; it seemed unfair that
                anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual youth as well
                as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.
                It will have to be paid for, they said. It isnt natural, and
                trouble will come of it!.
                <br>
                But so far trouble had not come; and as Mr. Baggins was
                generous with his money, most people were willing to forgive
                him his oddities and his good fortune. He remained
                on visiting terms with his relatives (except, of course, the
                Sackville-Bagginses), and he had many devoted admirers
                among the hobbits of poor and unimportant families. But he
                had no close friends, until some of his younger cousins began
                to grow up.
                <br>
                The eldest of these, and Bilbos favourite, was young Frodo
                Baggins. When Bilbo was ninety-nine he adopted Frodo as
                his heir, and brought him to live at Bag End; and the hopes of
                the Sackville-Bagginses were finally dashed. Bilbo and Frodo
                happened to have the same birthday, September 22nd. You
                had better come and live here, Frodo my lad, said Bilbo
                one day; and then we can celebrate our birthday-parties
                comfortably together. At that time Frodo was still in his
                tweens, as the hobbits called the irresponsible twenties
                between childhood and coming of age at thirty-three.
